🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: AI-Powered Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation! 🍎🥦

I’m thrilled to introduce my recent project, where I've developed an advanced AI model capable of identifying food items from images and estimating their calorie content. This innovative solution aims to help users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices with ease.

🔍 Project Highlights:

Food Recognition: Utilizes cutting-edge neural network architectures to accurately identify various food items from images.
Calorie Estimation: Provides reliable calorie counts to assist users in managing their dietary goals.
User-Friendly Interface: Integrates with a web interface, allowing seamless image uploads and instant feedback on food identification and nutritional content.
💡 Technologies Used:

TensorFlow & Keras for model development
MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient training and prediction
Streamlit for deploying the model on a web platform
I’m eager to see how this project can make a positive impact on dietary tracking and healthy living. Feel free to connect if you’re interested in learning more or discussing potential collaborations!
